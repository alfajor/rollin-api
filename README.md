# Rollin' Api

A basic WIP API service for BJJ academies listings. Data sources from a test JSON file with mock entries. Real data will continuously be added.

# Usage

To run locally, create and activate a virtual environment - `python3 -m venv .venv & source .venv/bin/activate`.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `fastapi dev api/main.py` to start the FastAPI development server.
Alternatively, run the setup script `init.sh`.

API routes are available at [http://localhost:8000/api/v1/academies](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/academies).
A user API key should be passed as a query parameter to the endopoint: `?api_key=<KEY>`.

Keys can be generated by entering a valid email into the form field.

# Database

A SQLite database handles the API user data.
